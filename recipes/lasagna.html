      <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 lb ground pork (optional, for added flavor)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional but adds richness)</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional for a slight kick)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the ricotta filling:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 cup grated mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley or basil, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce. In a large skillet, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and pork (if using), breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once browned, add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking for another 3-4 minutes until softened.</li>
      <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
      <li>Prepare the Ricotta Filling. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Mix until smooth. Add a pinch of salt and pepper for seasoning.</li>
      <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, laying them flat on a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>Assemble the Lasagna. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large baking dish (9x13 inches is typical), spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Layer 3-4 noodles over the sauce, followed by a third of the ricotta mixture, a third of the remaining meat sauce, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat this layering process two more times, ending with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Bake. Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from browning too quickly) and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Let it Rest</li>
      <li>Once the lasagna is done baking, let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley for a pop of color. Serve with a side of garlic bread and a crisp green salad for the perfect Italian meal!</li>
      <li>Enjoy your warm, cheesy, and satisfying lasagna!</li>
